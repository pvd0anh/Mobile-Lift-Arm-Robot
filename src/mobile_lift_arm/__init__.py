"""Top level package for the scissor‑lift control example.

This package contains a basic controller and GUI for a simple
scissor‑lift model.  The code has been refactored from the original
repository into a proper Python package so it can be installed with
setuptools and used as console entry points.  See the individual
modules for more details.
